# Income Prediction Extended Group Task

# How we worked:
Originally we had diverged at the start of the task and had all attempted to get our solution from the last assignment to work well on this assignment. This soon realized to not be the best approach and instead after we saw one solution be more successful we opted to improve on this solution.

One member had attempted the recommendations problem however given the timeframe and the possibility of not beating the baseline and getting low marks, it was deemed too risky and it was better to put all efforts on remaining near the top of income prediction extended.

The version in this repository is the version which produced the optimial result. We had various other versions (for both problems) however we found that some of the preprocessing work which had completed did not give as good as result as the one in this repository.

Also courtesy thanks to the Internet Applications module for providing free AWS credit to run on AWS Sagemaker which was slightly faster than Google Colab.

All in all took around 5-8 hours to run the solution depending on which service used.

Finishing 3rd on the Private Leaderboard, which was slightly surprising as we were 5th on the Public Leaderboard. Potentially the other teams had overfit slightly.
